Likewise, it shall not allow any emission of gases from crankcase ventilation system into the atmosphere. b) The Department, in collaboration with the DOTC, DTI and LGUs, shall develop an action plan for the control and management of air pollution from motor vehicles consistent with the Integrated Air Quality Framework. The DOTC shall enforce compliance with the emission standards for motor vehicles set by the Department. The DOTC may deputize other law enforcement agencies and LGUs for this purpose. To this end, the DOTC shall have the power to: (1) Inspect and monitor the emissions of motor vehicles; (2) Prohibit or enjoin the use of motor vehicles or a class of motor vehicles in any area or

In this regard, the DTI shall develop and implement standards and procedures for the certification of training institutions, instructors and facilities and the licensing of qualified private service centers and their technicians as prerequisite for performing the testing, servicing, repair and the required adjustment to the vehicle emission system.

271,"Section 16. Suspension of registration certificate. - If on inspection, as provided in paragraph (6) of Section four hereof, any motor vehicle is found to be unsightly, unsafe, overloaded, improperly marked or equipped, or otherwise unfit to be operated, or capable of causing excessive damage to the highways, or not conforming to minimum standards and specifications, the Commissioner may refuse to register the said motor vehicle, or if already registered, may require the number plates thereof to be surrendered to him, and upon seventy-two hours notice to the owner of the motor vehicle, suspend such registration until the defects of the vehicle are corrected and/or the minimum standards and specifications fully complied with. Whenever it shall appear from the records of the Commission that during any twelve-month period more than three warnings for violations of this Act have been given to the owner of a motor vehicle, or that the said owner has been convicted by a competent court more than once for violation of such laws, the Commissioner may, in his discretion, suspend the certificate of registration for a period not exceeding ninety days and, thereupon, shall require the immediate surrender of the number plates.

All motor trucks, whether for passenger or freight, private, or for hire, shall have the registered passenger gross and net weight capacities plainly and conspicuously marked on both sides thereof, in letters and numerals not less than five centimeters in height. ARTICLE IV Accessories of Motor Vehicles Section 34. (a) Tires of motor vehicles. - No motor vehicle with metallic tires shall be operated upon any public highway, and solid tires whenever used shall be of sufficient thickness to prevent the metal rims thereof from coming in direct contact with the road. (b) Brakes - Every motor vehicle with four or more wheels shall be provided with dual hydraulic brake system so that in case of hydraulic line failure affecting the braking efficiency of any of the four wheels at least either the front or rear wheels shall retain normal braking capabilities. In the absence of such dual braking system every motor vehicle with four or more wheels shall be provided with safety valve devices of such design and make so that failure of the hydraulic braking system of the vehicle because of leakage in the line of other parts of the system will not affect all wheels but rather render at all times effective the braking power of either the two front wheels or the two rear wheels when brakes are applied.
