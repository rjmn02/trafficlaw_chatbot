The rule is that a driver should ideally stay at least two or three seconds behind any vehicle that is directly in front. It is not a guide to safe distance but more of a guide to reaction time. The practice has been shown to considerably reduce the risk of road crash and the severity of any injury if a collision occurs. It also helps avoid tailgating or road rage for all drivers, since tailgating gives lesser collision avoidance time and driver reaction time. The safe distance is measured in time (seconds) rather than meters as it can be difficult to accurately judge distances while driving and what counts as a safe distance varies depending on speed. To estimate time, a driver can wait until the rear-end of the vehicle in front passes any distinct and fixed or stationary object on the roadway  e.g., a road sign, mailbox, lamp post.
