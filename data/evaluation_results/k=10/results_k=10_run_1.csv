According to Section 4 of REPUBLIC ACT NO. 10916, speed limiters are required for ""covered vehicles"" which are not specifically defined in the provided context. However, Section 3 of the same document defines ""covered vehicles"" as public utility vehicles and certain types of vehicles, but it does not include all vehicles.

However, Section 4 of REPUBLIC ACT NO. 10916 also states that ""No covered vehicle, following the effectivity of this Act, shall be allowed to run in any road, street or highway in the Philippines without a standard speed limiter in accordance with the standards and specifications approved by the DOTC."" This implies that all covered vehicles are required to have speed limiters.

Additionally, Section 5 of REPUBLIC ACT NO. 10916 states that ""No covered vehicle shall be registered by the LTO or given a franchise by the LTFRB without the standard speed limiter installed and set in the vehicle in compliance with Section 4 and Section 6 hereof."" This implies that all covered vehicles must have speed limiters in order to be registered or given a franchise.

Therefore, it appears that speed limiters are required for all covered vehicles, but the definition of ""covered vehicles"" is not explicitly stated in the provided context.","No, only certain types of vehicles are required to have speed limiters installed.
