emit exceptionally loud or startling sounds, including domelights and similar signalling or flashing devices actually
impede and confuse traffic, are inconsistent with sound traffic discipline and control on the highways, and in effect
constitute a major problem in the maintenance of peace and order;
NOW, THEREFORE, I, FERDINAND E. MARCOS, President of the Philippines, pursuant to Proclamation No. 1081,
dated September 21, 1972, and in my capacity as Commander-in-Chief of all the Armed Forces of the Philippines,
do hereby order and decree:
1. That it shall be unlawful for the owner or possessor of any motor vehicle to use or attach to his vehicle any
siren, bell, horn, whistle, or other similar gadgets that produce exceptionally loud or startling sound, including
domelights, blinkers and other similar signalling or flashing devices.
2. The gadgets or devices mentioned above may be attached to and use only on motor vehicles designated
for official use by the Armed Forces of the Philippines, National Bureau of Investigation, Land Transportation
Commission, Police Departments, Fire Departments, and hospital ambulances.","{'page': 0, 'title': '', 'author': '', 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'source': 'D:/Projects/trafficlaw-chatbot/data/raw/P.D.

with the Integrated Air Quality Improvement Framework to attain and maintain the ambient air quality standards
within their respective airsheds as provided in Sec. 9 hereof.
The local government units shall develop and submit to the Department a procedure for carrying out the action plan
for their jurisdiction. The Department, however, shall maintain its authority to independently inspect the enforcement
procedure adopted. The Department shall have the power to closely supervise all or parts of the air quality action
plan until such time the local government unit concerned can assume the function to enforce the standards set by
the Department.
A multi-sectoral monitoring team with broad public representation shall be convened by the Department for each
LGU to conduct periodic inspections of air pollution sources to assess compliance with emission limitations
contained in their permits.
Section 9. Airsheds. - Pursuant to Sec. 8 of this Act, the designation of airsheds shall be on the basis of, but not
limited to, areas with similar climate, meteorology and topology which affect the interchange and diffusion of

a Maximum limits represented by ninety-eight percentile (98%) values not to be exceed more
than once a year.
b Arithmetic mean
c SO2 and Suspended Particulate matter are sampled once every six days when using the
manual methods. A minimum of twelve sampling days per quarter of forty-eight sampling days
each year is required for these methods. Daily sampling may be done in the future once
continuous analyzers are procured and become available.
d Limits for Total Suspended Particulate Matter with mass median diameter less than 25-50 um.
e Annual Geometric Mean
f Provisional limits for Suspended Particulate Matter with mass median diameter less than 10
microns and below until sufficient monitoring data are gathered to base a proper guideline.

1 Pertinent ambient standards for Antimony, Arsenic, Cadmium, Asbestos, Nitric Acid and
Sulfuric Acid Mists in the 1978 NPCC Rules and Regulations may be considered as guides in
determining compliance.
2 Ninety-eight percentile (98%) values of 30-minute sampling measured at 250C and one
atmosphere pressure.
3 Other equivalent methods approved by the Department may be used.
The basis in setting up the ambient air quality guideline values and standards shall reflect, among others, the latest
scientific knowledge including information on:
a) Variable, including atmospheric conditions, which of themselves or in combination with other factors may
alter the effects on public health or welfare of such air pollutant;

this Act, and every two (2) years thereafter, review, or as the need therefore arises, revise and publish emission

shall be based on mass rate of emission for all stationary source of air pollution based on internationally accepted
standards, but not be limited to, nor be less stringent than such standards and with the standards set forth in this
section. The standards, whichever is applicable, shall be the limit on the acceptable level of pollutants emitted from
a stationary source for the protection of the public’s health and welfare.
With respect to any trade, industry, process and fuel-burning equipment or industrial plant emitting air pollutants, the
concentration at the point of emission shall not exceed the following limits:

Any vehicle suspected of violation of emission standards through visual signs, such as, but not limited to smoke-
belching, shall be subjected to an emission test by a duly authorized emission testing center. For this purpose, the
DOTC or its authorized testing center shall establish a roadside inspection system. Should it be shown that there
was no violation of emission standards, the vehicle shall be immediately released. Otherwise, a testing result
indicating an exceedance of the emission standards would warrant the continuing custody of the impounded vehicle

fulfillment of the undertaking by the owner/operator of the motor vehicle to make the necessary repairs so as to
comply with the standards. A pass shall herein be issued by the DOTC to authorize the use of the motor vehicle
within a specified period that shall not exceed seven (7) days for the sole purpose of making the necessary repairs
on the said vehicle. The owner/operator of the vehicle shall be required to correct its defects and show proof of

Accessories of Motor Vehicles
Section 34.
(a) Tires of motor vehicles. - No motor vehicle with metallic tires shall be operated upon any public highway,
and solid tires whenever used shall be of sufficient thickness to prevent the metal rims thereof from coming in
direct contact with the road.
(b) Brakes - Every motor vehicle with four or more wheels shall be provided with dual hydraulic brake system
so that in case of hydraulic line failure affecting the braking efficiency of any of the four wheels at least either
the front or rear wheels shall retain normal braking capabilities. In the absence of such dual braking system
every motor vehicle with four or more wheels shall be provided with safety valve devices of such design and
make so that failure of the hydraulic braking system of the vehicle because of leakage in the line of other
parts of the system will not affect all wheels but rather render at all times effective the braking power of either
the two front wheels or the two rear wheels when brakes are applied. This requirement, however, does not
apply to motor vehicles equipped with pneumatic braking system.
(b-1) Horns. - Every motor vehicle shall be provided with a horn or signalling devise in good working order:","{'page': 11, 'title': '', 'author': '', 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'source': 'D:/Projects/trafficlaw-chatbot/data/raw/Republic Act No. 4136_Land Transportation and Traffic Code.pdf', 'creator': 'Mozilla Firefox 141.0.3', 'modDate': '', 'moddate': '', 'subject': '', 'trapped': '', 'keywords': '', 'producer': 'cairo 1.18.0 (https://cairographics.org)', 'file_path': 'D:/Projects/trafficlaw-chatbot/data/raw/Republic Act No. 4136_Land Transportation and Traffic Code.pdf', 'total_pages': 18, 'creationDate': ""D:20250816000841+08'00"", 'creationdate': '2025-08-16T00:08:41+08:00'}"
